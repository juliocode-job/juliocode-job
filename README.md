üèÜ Golden Projects
A quick summary of the key projects I've developed. Each summary contains a case study explaining the business problem, my solution, the technologies used, and the impact it delivered.

ü§ñ Autonomous AI Sales Agent for Lead Outreach
Problem: Sales teams were losing time on manual lead qualification and follow-ups, causing high-value leads to be missed.

Solution: I built a 24/7 autonomous agent that perceives customer data, reasons to qualify leads, and acts by sending hyper-personalized emails and booking meetings. It uses a vector database for long-term memory, ensuring every interaction is context-aware.

Skills and Technologies:

Agentic AI, n8n, OpenAI, Supabase (Vector Database)

Impact: Eliminated the outreach bottleneck, allowing the sales team to focus 100% on closing deals.  ¬† 

üéôÔ∏è ConvoBot - Intelligent AI Meeting Assistant

Problem: Critical decisions and action items were being lost in manual note-taking during meetings, killing productivity.

Solution: I developed a voice-activated AI agent that joins meetings (Google Meet, Zoom), provides real-time transcription, and delivers intelligent summaries. It uses RAG to create a searchable knowledge base of all past conversations.

Skills and Technologies:

Voice AI,RAG,LangChain,Whisper,FastAPI

Impact: Automates 100% of note-taking, reduces post-meeting admin work by 90%, and ensures no decision is ever lost.  ¬† 

üìÑ AI-Powered HR Assistant for Candidate Experience
Problem: The HR team was spending over 10 hours a week on repetitive applicant questions, creating a poor candidate experience.

Solution: I built a full-stack chatbot with a decoupled JSON knowledge base, empowering the non-technical HR team to update FAQs instantly without any code changes.

Skills and Technologies:

Python,Scikit-learn,Flask API,NLP,JSON

Impact: Reduced HR workload by 45% and improved candidate engagement with 24/7, instant responses.  ¬† 

‚öôÔ∏è ZESU ‚Äì Intelligent Automation for IT Support

Problem: An enterprise IT team was overwhelmed with a high volume of repetitive Level 2 support requests, causing delays and pulling senior staff from critical incidents.
Solution: I implemented an internal AI chatbot using a RAG pipeline to securely access internal knowledge bases, providing real-time, step-by-step guidance for 143+ distinct IT procedures.

Skills and Technologies:

AI Agents,RAG,LangChain,TARS (Low-code solution)

Impact: Reduced average response times for L2 queries by 40% and increased IT team productivity.  ¬† 

üéì AI Tutor Evaluation for EdTech Safety & Efficacy

Problem: An EdTech client needed to integrate LLMs as AI tutors but faced significant risks from factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) that could harm learner trust and brand reputation.

Solution: I developed a comprehensive evaluation framework and a multi-faceted rubric to benchmark the performance and safety of LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT for educational use.

Skills and Technologies:

LLM Evaluation, Responsible AI, Prompt Engineering

Impact: Provided recommendations that led to a 25% reduction in model hallucinations on key subjects.  ¬† 

üéß High-Fidelity Data QA for Conversational AI

Problem: A leading tech company's voice assistant was underperforming due to inconsistent and noisy audio training data, leading to a frustrating user experience.

Solution: After passing a rigorous certification, I performed in-depth data validation and annotation on large-scale audio datasets, applying strict QA protocols to correct linguistic and acoustic inconsistencies.

Skills and Technologies:

Data Annotation, ASR/NLU, Quality Assurance, TTS & STT.

Impact: Contributed to a 15% reduction in the Word Error Rate (WER) for the client's primary ASR model.
