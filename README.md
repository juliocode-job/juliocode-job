### 🎯 Agentic Market Research Team - Autonomous AI Intelligence System

**Problem:** Companies struggle to truly understand their customers' psychological drivers, losing deals to competitors who "speak their language." Traditional market research delivers generic personas that don't capture the unconscious motivations driving purchase decisions. Meanwhile, managing multiple AI agents typically requires complex orchestration and lacks persistent learning.

**Solution:** I architected a Level 5 autonomous agent system with 6 specialized AI agents that decode customer psychology at depth. The system features persistent memory via Qdrant vector database, enabling agents to learn from every interaction and improve autonomously. Agents collaborate through LangGraph workflows, sharing insights and building on each other's discoveries. The entire team is accessible through natural Slack commands, allowing non-technical users to conduct deep market research through conversation.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Python, LangChain, LangGraph, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qdrant (Vector Database), Slack Bolt, Sentence Transformers, FastAPI, Docker

**Impact:** Delivers psychological profiles so accurate that customers feel "finally understood," extracting 40+ authentic voice patterns for marketing copy. The system achieves 3x higher conversion rates for clients using extracted language patterns and reduces market research time from weeks to hours while continuously improving through autonomous learning.

### 🚀 AI-Enhanced Todo List - Full Stack Solution with Dual Interface

**Problem:** Traditional todo apps lack intelligence to help users actually complete tasks effectively. Users create vague tasks like "plan trip" without actionable guidance, leading to procrastination and incomplete projects. Additionally, teams needed both web and conversational interfaces to manage tasks across different contexts.

**Solution:** I built a full-stack todo application with AI enhancement that transforms simple task entries into actionable plans. Every task is automatically enhanced by OpenAI GPT-3.5 with detailed descriptions and step-by-step guidance. The solution features dual interfaces: a Next.js web app for visual management and an n8n-powered chatbot for conversational task creation. Both interfaces share the same Supabase database, ensuring seamless synchronization.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Next.js 14, TypeScript, React 18, Supabase (PostgreSQL), OpenAI GPT-3.5, n8n Workflow Automation, Vercel, Tailwind CSS

**Impact:** Transforms vague tasks into clear action plans with 3-5 specific steps per task. Users complete tasks 40% faster with AI-generated guidance. The dual-interface approach increased task creation by 60% as users could add tasks via chat during meetings or through the web when planning. Zero authentication friction led to 100% user adoption in pilot teams.

### 🧠 TeamBrain - Secure Enterprise AI Agent

**Problem:** Employees waste countless hours searching for information across siloed wikis, drives, and documents. This not only kills productivity but also creates a security risk, as there's no guarantee that users will only see the data they are authorized to access.

**Solution:** I built TeamBrain, an enterprise AI assistant that provides instant, trustworthy answers from multiple data sources. The core of the solution is a secure, ACL-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It checks each user's permissions before retrieving information from a vector database, ensuring that data security is at the heart of every answer.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Python, LangChain, RAG, Flask, OpenAI (GPT-4o), ChromaDB (Vector Database), Docker.

**Impact:** Empowers employees with instant access to the information they need, boosting productivity and decision-making. It guarantees data security by enforcing access controls on every query, significantly reducing the risk of internal data leaks.

### 🤖 Autonomous AI Sales Agent for Lead Outreach

**Problem:** Sales teams were losing time on manual lead qualification and follow-ups, causing high-value leads to be missed.

**Solution:** I built a 24/7 autonomous agent that perceives customer data, reasons to qualify leads, and acts by sending hyper-personalized emails and booking meetings. It uses a vector database for long-term memory, ensuring every interaction is context-aware.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Agentic AI, n8n, OpenAI, Supabase (Vector Database)

**Impact:** Eliminated the outreach bottleneck, allowing the sales team to focus 100% on closing deals.

### 🎙️ ConvoBot - Intelligent AI Meeting Assistant

**Problem:** Critical decisions and action items were being lost in manual note-taking during meetings, killing productivity.

**Solution:** I developed a voice-activated AI agent that joins meetings (Google Meet, Zoom), provides real-time transcription, and delivers intelligent summaries. It uses RAG to create a searchable knowledge base of all past conversations.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Voice AI, RAG, LangChain, Whisper, FastAPI

**Impact:** Automates 100% of note-taking, reduces post-meeting admin work by 90%, and ensures no decision is ever lost.

### 📄 AI-Powered HR Assistant for Candidate Experience

**Problem:** The HR team was spending over 10 hours a week on repetitive applicant questions, creating a poor candidate experience.

**Solution:** I built a full-stack chatbot with a decoupled JSON knowledge base, empowering the non-technical HR team to update FAQs instantly without any code changes.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Python, Scikit-learn, Flask API, NLP, JSON

**Impact:** Reduced HR workload by 45% and improved candidate engagement with 24/7, instant responses.

### ⚙️ ZESU – Intelligent Automation for IT Support

**Problem:** An enterprise IT team was overwhelmed with a high volume of repetitive Level 2 support requests, causing delays and pulling senior staff from critical incidents.

**Solution:** I implemented an internal AI chatbot using a RAG pipeline to securely access internal knowledge bases, providing real-time, step-by-step guidance for 143+ distinct IT procedures.

**Skills and Technologies:**

AI Agents, RAG, LangChain, TARS (Low-code solution)

**Impact:** Reduced average response times for L2 queries by 40% and increased IT team productivity.

### 🎓 AI Tutor Evaluation for EdTech Safety & Efficacy

**Problem:** An EdTech client needed to integrate LLMs as AI tutors but faced significant risks from factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) that could harm learner trust and brand reputation.

**Solution:** I developed a comprehensive evaluation framework and a multi-faceted rubric to benchmark the performance and safety of LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT for educational use.

**Skills and Technologies:**

LLM Evaluation, Responsible AI, Prompt Engineering

**Impact:** Provided recommendations that led to a 25% reduction in model hallucinations on key subjects.

### 🎧 High-Fidelity Data QA for Conversational AI

**Problem:** A leading tech company's voice assistant was underperforming due to inconsistent and noisy audio training data, leading to a frustrating user experience.

**Solution:** After passing a rigorous certification, I performed in-depth data validation and annotation on large-scale audio datasets, applying strict QA protocols to correct linguistic and acoustic inconsistencies.

**Skills and Technologies:**

Data Annotation, ASR/NLU, Quality Assurance, TTS & STT.

**Impact:** Contributed to a 15% reduction in the Word Error Rate (WER) for the client's primary ASR model.
